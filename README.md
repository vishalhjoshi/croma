# How to use

## 1. Item Master

This is where you create/edit the item. Every item has some attributes, like what it's packing/unit, it's company name, it's salt/generic name, rac number, etc.

Now after adding basic details of the item, you can add the batches of the item by pressing "F9 key". Every batch has, its expiry, the stock(strip+nos), its sale/purchase price etc. Also one item can have more than one batches, so you can add more batches to the item.


## 2. Sales Invoice

Here you can create the invoice for the sale. The first input starts with the name of the party/patient followed by next input by name of the doctor, you have select the doctor from the list, also you can add(or edit) doctor without affecting the same form via pop up window.

Now that you have added the basic details of the invoice, you can add the item to the Invoice by simply pressing "F9 key".

After pressing the key, you will see a modal dialog box. Here you add the details of the Item. Add a item by entering a item name, and choose your item from autocomplete list. After selecting the item, you have to choose batch from the batch table, you can navigate the batches by up and down arrow keys. After selecting the batch, you have add the qty to the item and all other neccessary field required. You can add more item by repeating the same process

Note: After saving/updating the Invoice, you can print/view the Invoice bill generated.


## 3. Purchase Invoice

Here you can add your purchase bills. You can increase the stock by adding the purchased items in this section.

First add the basic details of the Invoice, like from which supplier it has been purchased, the amount, discount etc.

After adding basic details, add the items to the invoice, the procedure is same as that of sales invoice
